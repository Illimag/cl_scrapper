# Email Templates

These are some custom email templates.

Depending on certain factors:

If the post is located in San Francisco Bay Area then the title of the email should say:

LOCAL BAY AREA WEB DEVELOPER

or something along those lines.

If the leads are located outside the bay area but in Califonia the title should be

LOCAL CALIFORNIA WEB DEVELOPER:

This way we can start communication, if they are located in socal then there is a real possibility of being able 

to eventually meet in person.

It's only a few hours drive.

If the post is outside california then make sure to let them know that im a US Citizen

SO the title should be something along the lines of:

REMOTE USA WEB DEVELOPER - LOCATED BAY AREA

Because of the amount of replies they will be getting, letting them know where I am located will make it easier to start communcaiton.

Next depending on the filter,
