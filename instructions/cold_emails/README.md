# How to send a reponse to leads.

I'm not too sure how to get people to open the emails.

I've read somewhere that people dont like to open links and attachments.

So I think the best way is to send an email with images embedded into the email.

We need to rethink how to send emails so we can get more responses.

Or have somekind of two part system that send the link in the second response..
