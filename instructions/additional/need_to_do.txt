# Need to do.

Mainly we need to organize the CL URLs according to the cities with the most traffic.

There are 3 cluster.

spider.py
spider1.py
spider2.py

1 of the cluster will be cities will very low traffic. This is the majority.
1 of the clusters will be cities will medium traffic.
1 of the clusters will be cities will high amounts of traffic.

LT-Cluster
MT-Cluster
HT-Cluster

Let's say that it takes 1hr to go through 50 URLS.

HT - 200 URLS - 4 HRS
MT - 500 URLS - 10 HRS
LT - 1800 URLS - 1 DAY
