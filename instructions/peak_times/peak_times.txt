# Peak times to run the scrapper.

Because we want to reply to people asap.

We should have the scrapper running at specific timees and then rerun from the beginng to see if there are any new posting.

This is especially essential for the cities with the most traffic.

For cities that do not have as much traffic we should be OK. with running the scrapper once a day.
