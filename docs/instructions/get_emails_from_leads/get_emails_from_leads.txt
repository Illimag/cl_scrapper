# Get emails from leads.

This is how I plan to get the emails from the leads.

The problem is that I don't know if it's possible to get the html page to show the email with software running on my side.

So instead, have a local machine that has a macro or somekind of desktop automation software.

Send it a txt file with all the URL leads.

It will get the first URL lead.

the macro will start.

Open a browser.

Enter the proxy.

Open the url.

macro will go to the button based on image or mointor mouse location.

automated click

then the email will show.

click the email.

copy and paste to another text file.

No captias because new IP address each time.

Loop through all the urls.

This is how we will convert the leads which are URLS into emails.
