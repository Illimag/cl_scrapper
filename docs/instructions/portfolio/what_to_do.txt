# How to send a portfolio to leads to convert them into clients

So we should send each lead two responses:

One from jaemnkm
One from hillotechllc

I think the portfolio should be different in each one.

Then depending on what kind of client they are they may want to work with the agency or on a more personal level.

Also this allows us to have two opportunties for them to respond.

But the money will all be funneled into hillotech, llc.
