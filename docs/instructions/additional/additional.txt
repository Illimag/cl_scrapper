# This is an addition that is required for the script.

Basically there should be around 200-300 urls that are high targets because maybe they are cl's in large cities.

So one of the clusters should run those 200-300 non stop in repeat.

Because we want to reply to these ASAP.

## Also I think because were using proxies there are no captias.

If this is true. We should update the scrapper to get the email address and phone numbers of the posting.

## Later on maybe we can automate this process more.

For example we can mass email them and mass phone number them.

For now we should look through each lead and make a custom reply for each one.

## We should also use the filter function to filter the leads into specific catefories.

For example if they are looking for someone to help with website work, etc.

Then we should have the filter figure that out based on the wording of the post and then we should have a customized email according to the filter.
