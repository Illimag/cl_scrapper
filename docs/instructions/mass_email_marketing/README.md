# Mass emails

There is a limit of 500 email per day with gmail.

I strongly suspect that we will not be email more than 100 people per day.

If this is so we may not need to use any kind of mass emailing software.

But in case I'm wrong we should use Mail for Good software to mass email marketing.

As well as making sure we keep track of the hits we get from emails.
